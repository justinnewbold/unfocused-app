## 🔑 Claude AI Integration (Optional)

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

> "I need to WANT to keep opening the app, not just be reminded to do it."

UnFocused is built on the understanding that ADHD isn't a discipline problem - it's about how your brain processes dopamine, manages working memory, and initiates action.

**Every other app:** "Here's our system. Adapt to it."

**UnFocused:** "I'll learn YOU. And adapt to you."
